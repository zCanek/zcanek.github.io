For example, a hostname such as relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com could have, say, two aliases such as enterprise.com and www.enterprise.com. In this case, the first hostname is said to be a canonical hostname.\nDNS can be invoked to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname as well as the IP address of the host. The hostname of the Yahoo mail server is more complicated than simply yahoo.com (the canonical hostname might be something like relay1.west-coast.yahoo.com). DNS is invoked to solve the simpler hostnames in email addresses<br> DNS is also used to perform load distribution among replicated servers, such as replicated <a data-href=\"Web Server\" href=\"indexes/networking/application-layer/web/web-server.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Web Server</a>s. Busy sites like chatgpt.com are replicated over multiple servers, with each server running on a different <a data-href=\"End System\" href=\"indexes/networking/end-system.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">End System</a> and each having a different IP address. For replicates servers, a set of IP addresses is thus associated with one alias hostname, when a client requests for the hostname, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the ordering of the addresses within each reply, this distributes the traffic among the replicated servers. DNS uses a laaarge number of servers, organized in a hierarchical fashion and distributed around the world. No single DNS server has all of the mappings for all of the hosts in the Internet. Instead, the mappings are distributed across the DNS servers.There are 3 classes of DNS servers, but before that i'll explain ho these three clases of servers interact. Suppose a DNS clients wants to determine the IP address for the hostname www.amazon.com:\nThe client first contacts one of the root servers, which returns IP addresses for TLD servers for the top-level domain .com\nThe client then contacts one of these TDL servers, which returns the IP address of an authoritative server for amazon.com\nFinally the client contacts one of the authoritative servers for amazon.com.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20260210170757.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20260210170757.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 440px; max-width: 100%;\">\nThese provide the IP addresses of the TLD servers. With more than 1,000 root servers over the world, these servers are copies of 13 different root servers, managed by 12 different organizations, and coordinated through the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).TLD servers provide the IP addresses for authoritative DNS servers. For each of the top-level domains (such as com, org, gov, mx, uk) there is a TLD server (or server cluster).Every accessible host (web or mail servers) on the Internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records that map the names of those hosts to IP addresses. An organization’s authoritative DNS server houses these DNS records. An organization can implement its own authoritative DNS server or it can pay to have these records stored in an authoritative server of some service provider.<br>Each <a data-href=\"ISP\" href=\"indexes/networking/isp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ISP</a> has a local DNS server (also called default name server). When a host connects to an ISP, t he ISP provides the host with the IP addresses of one or more of its local DNS servers.\nA host’s local DNS server is typically “close to” the host. When a host makes a DNS query, the query is sent to the local DNS server, which acts a proxy, forwarding the query into the DNS server hierarchy.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20260210185955.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20260210185955.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 360px; max-width: 100%;\">\nHost cse.nyu.edu sends a DNS query message to its local DNS server dns.nyu.edu, the query contains the hostname to be translated, namely gaia.cs.umass.edu\nLocal DNS server forwards the query to a root DNS server.\nRoot server takes note of the .edu suffix and returns to the local DNS server a list of IP addresses for TLD servers responsible for edu\nLocal DNS resends the query message to one of these TLD servers.\nTLD server takes note of the umass.edu suffix and responds with the IP address of the authoritative DNS server of the requested hostname, namely dns.umass.edu.\nLocal DNS resends query directly to dns.umass.edu.\nAuthoritative server responds with the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu\nLocal DNS finally returns the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu to the requesting host.\nWhen a DNS server receives a DNS reply (a mapping from a hostname to an IP address), it can cache the mapping in its local memory. If a hostname/IP address pair is cached in a DNS server and another query arrives to the DNS server for the same hostname, the DNS server can provide the desired IP address, even if it is not authoritative for the hostname. DNS servers discard cached information after a period of time (often set to two days).A local DNS server also caches the IP addresses of TLD servers, bypassing the root DNS servers in a query chain. Root server are almost always bypassed.This way DNS exploits DNS caching in order to improve the delay performance and to reduce the number of DNS messages ricocheting around the Internet.DNS servers store resource records (RRs), including RRs that provide hostname-to-IP mappings. Each DNS reply message carries one or more resource recordsAn RR is a four-tuple that contains the following fields:Name, Value, Type, TTL\nTTL is the time to live of the resource record; it determines when a resource should be removed from a cache. The meaning of Name and Value depend on Type: If Type=A, then Name is a hostname and Value is the IP address for the hostname. Thus, a Type A record provides the standard hostname-to-IP address mapping. (relay1.bar.foo.com, 145.37.93.126, A) is a Type A record. Even if a DNS server is not authoritative (suppose a TLD server), it may contain a Type A record in its cache pointing to an authoritative one.) If Type=NS, then Name is a domain (foo.com) and Value is the hostname of an authoritative DNS server able to obtain the IP addresses for hosts in the domain. This record is used to route DNS queries further along in the query chain. (foo.com, dns.foo.com, NS) is a Type NS record If Type=CNAME, then Value is a canonical hostname for the alias hostname Name . This record can provide querying hosts the canonical name for a hostname. (foo.com, relay1.bar.foo.com, CNAME) is a CNAME record. If Type=MX, then Value is the canonical name of a mail server that has an alias hostname Name. As an example, (foo.com, mail.bar.foo.com, MX) is an MX record. MX records allow the hostnames of mail servers to have simple aliases. To obtain the canonical name for the mail server, a DNS client would query for an MX record; to obtain the canonical name for another server, the DNS client would query for the CNAME record.\nBoth DNS query and DNS reply messages have the same format:\nThe first 12 bytes is the header section. The first field is a 2-bytes number that identifies the query allowing the client to match received replies with sent queries. There are a number of flags in the flag field. A 1-bit flag indicates whether the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). A 1-bit authoritative flag is set in a reply message when a DNS server is an authoritative server for a queried name. A 1-bit recursion-desired flag is set when a client (host or DNS server) desires that the DNS server perform recursion when it doesn’t have the record. A 1-bit recursion-available field is set in a reply if the DNS server supports recursion. In the header, there are also four number-of fields. These fields indicate the number of occurrences of the four types of data sections that follow the header.\nA question section contains information about the query, it includes (1) a name field that contains the name that is being queried, and (2) a type field that indicates the type of question being asked about the name - for example, a host address associated with a name (Type A).\nAnswer section contains the resource records for the name that was originally queried. A reply can return multiple RRs in the answer, since a hostname can have multiple IP addresses (like for replicated servers).\nAuthority section contains records of other authoritative servers.\nAdditional section contains other helpful records.\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20260212175715.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20260212175715.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 500px; max-width: 100%;\">A registrar is a commercial entity that verifies the uniqueness of the domain name and enters the domain name into the DNS database.

The TCP congestion-control mechanism throttles a sending process (client or server) when the network is congested between sender and receiver. TCP congestion control also attempts to limit each TCP connection to its fair share of network bandwidth.<br>Transport Layer Security (TLS)\nTCP-enhanced-with-TLS provides critical process-to-process security services, including encryption, data integrity, and end-point authentication. TLS is not a third Internet transport protocol, but instead is an enhancement of TCP, with the enhancements being implemented in the application layer. In particular, if an application wants to use the services of TLS, it needs to include TLS code (existing, highly optimized libraries and classes) in both the client and server sides of the application. TLS has its own socket <a data-href=\"API\" href=\"indexes/malware/api.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">API</a> that is similar to the traditional TCP socket API. When an application uses TLS, the sending process passes cleartext data to the TLS socket; TLS in the sending host then encrypts the data and passes the encrypted data to the TCP socket. The encrypted data travels over the Internet to the TCP socket in the receiving process. The receiving socket passes the encrypted data to TLS, which decrypts the data. Finally, TLS passes the cleartext data through its TLS socket to the receiving process.\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251019160811.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20251019160811.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 500px; max-width: 100%;\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Connection-oriented service","level":2,"id":"Connection-oriented_service_0"},{"heading":"Reliable data transfer service","level":2,"id":"Reliable_data_transfer_service_0"}],"links":["indexes/networking/transport-layer/reliable-data-transfer.html","indexes/networking/protocol.html","indexes/networking/client-and-server.html","indexes/networking/packet.html","indexes/networking/socket.html","cs_app/glossary/processes.html","indexes/networking/internet.html","indexes/malware/api.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"indexes/networking/transport-layer/tcp.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["assets/pasted-image-20251019160811.png"],"createdTime":1762228755640,"modifiedTime":1760911702137,"sourceSize":2746,"sourcePath":"Indexes/Networking/Transport Layer/TCP.md","exportPath":"indexes/networking/transport-layer/tcp.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":18,"backlinks":["indexes/networking/application-layer/http/http.html"],"type":"markdown"},"indexes/networking/transport-layer/udp.html":{"title":"UDP","icon":"","description":"UDP is no-frills, lightweight transport protocol, providing minimal services.

The application layer is where network applications and their application-layer protocols reside. This includes many protocols, such as the HTTP protocol, SMTP, FTP, etc.<br>We’ll see that certain network functions, such as the translation of human-friendly names for Internet end systems like www.ietf.org to a 32-bit network address, are also done with the help of a specific application-layer protocol, namely, the domain name system (<a data-href=\"DNS\" href=\"indexes/networking/application-layer/dns/dns.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">DNS</a>)An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems, with the application in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of information with the application in another end system. We’ll refer to this packet of information at the application layer as a message.This layer transports application-layer messages between application endpoints.\nIn the internet, there are two transport protocols: TCP and UDP, either of which can transport application-layer messagesTCP provides a connection-oriented service to its applications. This service includes guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination and flow control (that is, sender/receiver speed matching). TCP also breaks long messages into shorter segments and provides a congestion-control mechanism, so that a source throttles its transmission rate when the network is congested.UDP protocol provides a connectionless service to its applications. This is a no-frills service that provides no reliability, no flow control, and no congestion control. In this book, we’ll refer to a transport-layer packet as a segment.The Internet’s network layer is responsible for moving network-layer packets known as datagrams from one host to another. The Internet transport-layer protocol (TCP or UDP) in a source host passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address to the network layer, just as you would give the postal service a letter with a destination address. The network layer then provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport layer in the destination host.The Internet’s network layer includes the celebrated IP protocol, which defines the fields in the datagram as well as how the end systems and routers act on these fields. There is only one IP protocol, and all Internet components that have a network layer must run the IP protocol. The Internet’s network layer also contains routing protocols that determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and destinations. <br>The Internet’s network layer routes a datagram through a series of routers between the source and destination. To move a packet from one node (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"End System\" data-href=\"End System\" href=\"indexes/networking/end-system.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">host</a> or router) to the next node in the route, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer. In particular, at each node, the network layer passes the datagram down to the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route. At this next node, the link layer passes the datagram up to the network layerThe services provided by the link layer depend on the specific link-layer protocol that is employed over the link.As datagrams typically need to traverse several links to travel from source to destination, a datagram may be handled by different link-layer protocols at different links along its route.The network layer will receive a different service from each of the different link-layer protocols. In this book, we’ll refer to the link-layer packets as frames.While the job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one network element to an adjacent network element, the job of the physical layer is to move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next.The protocols in this layer are again link dependent and further depend on the actual transmission medium of the link (for example, twisted-pair copper wire, single-mode fiber optics). For example, Ethernet has many physical-layer protocols: one for twisted-pair copper wire, another for coaxial cable, another for fiber, and so on. In each case, a bit is moved across the link in a different way.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Application
