Binary notation is too verbose, while with decimal notation it is tedious to convert to and from bit patterns.. Instead, we write bit patterns as base-16, or hexadecimal numbers\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250716131144.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20250716131144.png\" target=\"_self\">\nIn C, numeric constants starting with 0x or 0X are interpreted as being in hexadecimal. The characters ‘A’ through ‘F’ may be written in either upper- or lowercase. For example, we could write the number FA1D37B16 as 0xFA1D37B, as 0xfa1d37b, or even mixing upper- and lowercase (e.g., 0xFa1D37b).When a value x is a power of 2, that is, x = 2n for some nonnegative integer n, we can readily write x in hexadecimal form by remembering that the binary representation of x is simply 1 followed by n zeros. The hexadecimal digit 0 represents 4 binary zeros. So, for n written in the form i + 4j , where 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, we can write x with a leading hex digit of 1 (i = 0), 2 (i = 1), 4 (i = 2), or 8 (i = 3), followed by j hexadecimal 0s. As an example, for x = 2,048 = 2 11, we have n = 11 = 3 + 4 . 2, giving hexadecimal representation 0x800.To convert a decimal number x to hexadecimal, we can repeatedly divide x by 16, giving a quotient q and a remainder r, such that x = q . 16 + r. We then use the hexadecimal digit representing r as the least significant digit and generate the remaining digits by repeating the process on q. As an example, consider the conversion of decimal 314,156: From this we can read off the hexadecimal representation as 0x4CB2C.Conversely, to convert a hexadecimal number to decimal, we can multiply each of the hexadecimal digits by the appropriate power of 16.

Then (assuming <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Data Types\" data-href=\"Data Types\" href=\"indexes/coding/c井/data-types.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">data type</a> int has a 32-bit representation) the 4 bytes of x would be stored in memory locations 0x100, 0x101, 0x102, and 0x103.For ordering the bytes representing an object, there are two common conventions. Consider a -bit integer having a bit representation , where is the most significant bit and is the least. Assuming w is a multiple of 8, these bits can be grouped as bytes, with the most significant byte having bits , the least significant byte having bits , and the other bytes having bits from the middle. Some machines choose to store the object in memory ordered from least significant byte to most, while other machines store them from most to least. The former convention—where the least significant byte comes first—is referred to as little endian. The latter convention—*where the most significant byte comes first—is referred to as big endian.<br>Suppose the variable x of type int and at address 0x100 has a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation\" data-href=\"2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation\" href=\"cs_app/ii.-representing-and-manipulating-information/2.1-information-storage/2.1.1-hexadecimal-notation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">hexadecimal</a> value of 0x01234567. The ordering of the bytes within the address range 0x100 through 0x103 depends on the type of machine:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250716204848.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20250716204848.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNote that in the word 0x01234567 the high-order byte has a hexadecimal value 0x01, while the low-order byte has value 0x67.For most application programmers, the byte orderings used by their machines are totally invisible; programs compiled for either class of machine give identical results.\nMost Intel-compatible machines operate exclusively in little-endian mode. On the other hand, most machines from IBM and Oracle operate in big-endian mode.\nMany recent microprocessor chips are bi-endian, meaning that they can be configured to operate as either liitle or big endian machines The first is when binary data are communicated over a network between different machines. A common problem is for data produced by a little-endian machine to be sent to a big-endian machine, or vice versa, leading to the bytes within the words being in reverse order for the receiving program. To avoid such problems, code written for networking applications must follow established conventions for byte ordering to make sure the sending machine converts its internal representation to the network standard, while the receiving machine converts the network standard to its internal representation.\nA second case where byte ordering becomes important is when looking at the byte sequences representing integer data. This occurs often when inspecting machine-level programs. As an example, the following line occurs in a file that gives a text representation of the machine-level code for an Intel x86-64 processor: 4004d3: 01 05 43 0b 20 00 add %eax,0x200b43(%rip) This line was generated by a disassembler, a tool that determines the instruction sequence represented by an executable program file.\nWe simply note that this line states that the hexadecimal byte sequence 01 05 43 0b 20 00 is the byte-level representation of an instruction that adds a word of data to the value stored at an address computed by adding 0x200b43 to the current value of the program counter, the address of the next instruction to be executed. If we take the final 4 bytes of the sequence 43 0b 20 00 and write them in reverse order, we have 00 20 0b 43. Dropping the leading 0, we have the value 0x200b43, the numeric value written on the right. Having bytes appear in reverse order is a common occurrence when reading machine-level program representations generated for little-endian machines such as this one. The natural way to write a byte sequence is to have the lowest-numbered byte on the left and the highest on the right, but this is contrary to the normal way of writing numbers with the most significant digit on the left and the least on the right.\nA third case where byte ordering becomes visible is when programs are written that circumvent the normal type system. In the C language, this can be done using a cast or a union to allow an object to be referenced according to a different data type from which it was created. Such coding tricks are strongly discouraged for most application programming, but they can be quite useful and even necessary for system-level programming.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; typedef unsigned char *byte_pointer; void show_bytes(byte_pointer start, size_t len) { int i; for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) printf(\" %.2x\", start[i]); printf(\"\\n\");\n} void show_int(int x) { show_bytes((byte_pointer) &amp;x, sizeof(int)); } void show_float(float x) { show_bytes((byte_pointer) &amp;x, sizeof(float));\n} void show_pointer(void *x) {\nshow_bytes((byte_pointer) &amp;x, sizeof(void *));\n}\n//CODE TO PRINT THE BYTE REPRESENTATION OF PROGRAM OBJECTS\nThese procedures use the C sizeof operator to determine the number of bytes used by the object. In general, the expression sizeof(T ) returns the number of bytes required to store an object of type T.Using sizeof rather than a fixed value is one step toward writing code that is portable across different machine types.void test_show_bytes(int val)\n{ int ival = val; float fval = (float) ival; int *pval = &amp;ival; show_int(ival); show_float(fval); show_pointer(pval);\n}\n//THIS CODE PRINTS THE BYTE REPRESENTATION OF SAMPLE DATA OBJECTS\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250717130734.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20250717130734.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 600px; max-width: 100%;\"><br>\nOur argument 12,345 has <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation\" data-href=\"2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation\" href=\"cs_app/ii.-representing-and-manipulating-information/2.1-information-storage/2.1.1-hexadecimal-notation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">hexadecimal</a> representation (in big-endian). We can see that the leas significant byte value of is printed first for Linux 32, Windows and Linux 64, indicating little-endian machines, and last for Sun, indicating big-endian.\nNote that the Linux 32, Windows and Sun machines use 4-byte addresses, while the Linux 64 uses 8-byte addresses.Although the floating-point and the int data both encode the numeric value 12,345, they have different patterns: for the integer and for floating point. In general, these two formats use different encoding schemes.

Even on the Inter Core i7 Haswell we use as our reference machine, integer multiply requires 3 clock cycles. So, one important optimization used by compiler is to attempt to replace multiplications by constant factors with combinations of shift and addition operations. We will first consider the case of multiplying by a power of 2, and then we will generalize this to arbitrary constants.Multiplication by a power of 2\nLet be the unsigned integer represented by bit pattern . Then for any , the -bit unsigned representation of is given by , where zeros have been added to the right.\nSo, for example, 11 can be represented for as . Shifting this left by yields the 6-bit vector, which encodes the unsigned number .When shifting left by for a fixed word size, the high-order bits are discarded, yieldingbut this is also the case when performing multiplication on fixed-size words. We can therefore see that shifting a value left is equivalent to performing unsigned multiplication by a power of 2:Unsigned multiplication by a power of 2\nFor C variables and with unsigned values and , such that , the C expression yields the value .\nSince the bit-level operation of fixed-size two’s-complement arithmetic is equivalent to that for unsigned arithmetic, we can make a similar statement about the relationship between left shifts and multiplication by a power of 2 for two’s-complement arithmetic:Two's-complement multiplication by a power of 2\nFor C variables and with two's-complement value and unsigned value , such that , the C expression yields the value .\nNote that multiplying by a power of 2 can cause overflow with either unsigned or two’s-complement arithmetic. Our result shows that even then we will get the same effect by shifting. Returning to our earlier example, we shifted the -bit pattern (numeric value ) left by two positions to get (numeric value ). Truncating this to bits gives (numeric value ).Given that integer multiplication is more costly than shifting and adding, many C compilers try to remove many cases where an integer is being multiplied by a constant with combinations of shifting, adding, and subtracting. For example, suppose a program contains the expression . Recognizing that , the compiler can rewrite the multiplication as , replacing one multiplication with three shifts and two additions. The two computations will yield the same result, regardless of whether is unsigned or two’s complement, and even if the multiplication would cause an overflow. Even better, the compiler can also use the property to rewrite the multiplication as , requiring only two shifts and a subtractionGeneralizing from our example, consider the task of generating code for the expression , for some constant . The compiler can express the binary representation of $K as an alternating sequence of zeros and ones: By adding together the results for each run, we are able to compute x * K without any multiplications. Of course, the trade-off between using combinations of shifting, adding, and subtracting versus a single multiplication instruction depends on the relative speeds of these instructions, and these can be highly machine dependent. Most compilers only perform this optimization when a small number of shifts, adds, and subtractions suffice.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"cs_app/ii.-representing-and-manipulating-information/2.3-integer-arithmetic/2.3.6-multiplying-by-constants.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1762229046602,"modifiedTime":1754702290049,"sourceSize":4404,"sourcePath":"CS_APP/II.
