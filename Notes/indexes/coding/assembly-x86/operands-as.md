Most instructions have one or more *operands* specifying the source values to use in performing an operation and the destination location into which to place the result.

Source values can be given as constants or read from registers or memory. Results can be stored in either registers or memory. Thus, the different operand possibilities can be classified into three types
- *immediate*, is for constant values. In ATT format assembly code, these are written with a "$" followed by an integer using standard C notation -i.e.,` $-577` or `$0x1F`. Different instructions allow different ranges of immediate values; the assembler will automatically select the most compact way of encoding a value.
- *[[register]]*, denotes the contents of a register, one of the 16-, 8-, 4-, 2-, or 1-byte low-order portions of the registers for operands having 64, 32, 16, or 8 bits, respectively. n Figure 3.3, we use the notation $r_a$ to denote an arbitrary register $a$ and indicate its value with the reference $R[r_a]$, viewing the set of registers as an array $R$ indexed by register identifiers.
- *memory* reference, in this we access some memory location according to a computed address, often called the *effective address*. Since we view the memory as a large array of bytes, we use the notation $M_b[Addr]$ to denote a reference to the $b$-byte value stored in memory starting at address *Addr*. To simplify things, we will generally drop the subscript $_b$.

  There are many different *addressing modes* allowing different forms of memory references. The most general form is shown at the bottom of the table with syntax $Imm(r_b,r_i,s)$. Such a reference has four components: an immediate offset $Imm$, a base register $r_b$, an index register $r_i$, and a scale factor $s$, where $s$ must be 1, 2, 4, or 8. Both the base and index must be 64-bit registers. The effective address is computed as $Imm + R[r_b] + R[r_i] · s$. This general form is often seen when referencing elements of arrays. The other forms are simply special cases of this general form where some of the components are omitted.
